# CNN for MNIST Digit Classification

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## 🧠 Objective
To build and evaluate a CNN model capable of recognizing digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset.

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Tasks Completed
- Loaded and preprocessed MNIST dataset  
- Built a CNN with convolution, pooling, and dense layers  
- Trained and validated the model using accuracy as the primary metric  
- Evaluated model performance on test data with plots and metrics
